## [2.1.0] - 2022-03-08

### Added

- `dmenu` can now be specified as the dmenu backend, this was motivated by
  [this](https://codeberg.com/dnkl/fuzzel/commit/ffec2bc2ef7e5ca1398ab7ed7f134bd769706dcd) commit

### Fixed

- using `wofi` will no longer create a directory with an empty name containing another directory
  called `dev` with a file called `null`

### Changed

- `tessen -v` will now print only the version number and will omit the unnecessary prefix `tessen
  version`

## [2.0.2] - 2022-03-02

### Fixed

- the clipboard is not cleared if no action is performed and tessen exits when ESC is pressed

- if the `sleep` process which runs for `PASSWORD_STORE_CLIP_TIME` is terminated, the clipboard is
  cleared as expected

## [2.0.1] - 2022-03-01

### Fixed

- even if the selected file has 0 size, it will now be considered as a valid selection because the
  file name may be used as a value for autotyping/copying

- autotyping data no longer clears the clipboard

## [2.0.0] - 2022-02-19

### Added

- gopass has been added as a supported pass backend

- tessen can now be configured using a configuration file placed at
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tessen/config`, `$HOME/.config/tessen/config`, or a custom location specified
  using the new `-c`, `--config`, and `--config=` option

- the user key, url key, and the autotype key can now be specified in the configuration file and
  these keys can be set to simple regular expressions such as `(username|login)` to consider
  multiple values when selecting keys

- a man page for the tessen configuration file has been added

- added the `-s` option to simplify the code using shfmt in the github actions job and in
  CONTRIBUTING.md

- an optional patch has been provided to change the shebang back to `#!/bin/bash` and to set the
  `$PATH` explicitly to `/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin`

### Changed

- instead of considering the last non-unique key in the list of key-value pairs inside a password
  store file, the first non-unique key will now be considered and other keys with the same name will
  be ignored

- if copy action is selected, the option to autotype is no longer shown

- fuzzel no longer spams the terminal when it's being used as the dmenu backend

- the shebang for bash has been changed from `#!/bin/bash` to `#!/usr/bin/env bash` to accomodate
  users who don't use an operating system with `/bin/bash`

### Removed

- the `-b`, `--backend`, `--backend=` options have been removed and replaced with `-d`, `--dmenu`,
  and `--dmenu=`

- the following environment variables are no longer used for configuring how tessen behaves, the
  same functionality has been provided in the form of a configuration file

    TESSEN_BACKEND
    TESSEN_ACTION
    TESSEN_USERKEY
    TESSEN_URLKEY
    TESSEN_AUTOKEY
    TESSEN_DELAY

  basename of the selected file will be used as the username
